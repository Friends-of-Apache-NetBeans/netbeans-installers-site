# Distribution site for Apache NetBeans installers

This repository provides the sources for the Friends of Apache NetBeans installers
website at https://installers.friendsofapachenetbeans.org

## Updating the site

All links, versions and SHA hashes for the installer packages should be added
to the frontmatter of the `index.html` page. The steps to achieve this are described in the [wiki](https://github.com/Friends-of-Apache-NetBeans/netbeans-installers-site/wiki)



## Website source

The sources for this site are derived from the Neat Whiskey base theme for Jekyll
- see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
